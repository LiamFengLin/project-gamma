1. What we have done:

# We pair up to two groups to analyze the subject001 (patients) and subject011 (healthy control)

(1) remove the first five of the data
(2) do the outlier analysis (std, rms). remove the outliers.
(3) find and plot the correlation coefficients matrix (use 0-1 time course) . try to figure out the active regions
(4) get the hrf function and convolve the data.
(5) use the Kmean to understand the brain better in cluster/region level.

2. What we are going to do for next week:
(1) find and plot the correlation coef. matrix using hrf and the average hrf. compare the three methods for the correlation and discuss the best one.
(2) get the residuals distribution and compare it to the normal distribution so as to see whether the linear model is appropriate. 
(3) prepare for the presentation

3. Problem we are facing:
(1) time unit? 0.1 or 1 for TR?
(2) transfer the data into Talariach space to discover the ROIs.
(3) Resting state data in the dataset
